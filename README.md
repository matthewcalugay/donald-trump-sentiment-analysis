# Hi :)

Welcome to my sentiment analysis on Donald Trump's twitter! It utilizes VaderSentiment and follows the average sentiment per day across the Covid-19 pandemic (March-Present).

Additionally, there are visualizations showing Donald Trump's most active hours of the day when tweeting about Covid, his most used hashtags, as well as a word cloud of his last 10k tweets. 

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, wordcloud, VaderSentiment, NLTK
